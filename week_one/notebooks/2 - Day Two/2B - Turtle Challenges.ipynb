    "# Day Two Turtle Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "You've learned the basics of python programming and now it's time to challenge yourself and make something new! In this directory, you'll find 10 turtle challenges that are meant to test your learning so far AND introduce you to more possibilities with the turtle package itself. You are allowed to use ANY tools that you want in order to complete this challenge. These would include: your partner, the TA's, the instructors, Google, ChatGPT, chat.indigigenius.org, or anything else you can think of. What matters is that you keep moving and ask questions when you get stuck. You agree on which challenge to tackle with your partner (you may need to do the preference of one partner first then the other). You should also plan, on notebook paper or within comments, exactly how you plan to complete the challenges. Good luck! Here's an overview of each challenge.\n",
