    "- **Change sizes**: Modify the `side_length` and other distance variables\n",
    "- **Change speeds**: Adjust the `speed()` values (1=slow, 10=fast)\n",
    "- **Change backgrounds**: Modify `screen.bgcolor()` values\n",

    "### Medium Challenges:\n",
    "- **Draw a hexagon**: 6 sides, 60-degree turns (360° ÷ 6)\n",
